# indeed_scraper
Scrape Singapore jobs from Indeed.com

**Description**

This project aims to scrape Singapore job postings from Indeed.com through the terminal. Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter search keywords pertaining to the job title that they want to search. After which, the program will retrieve job postings from the last 3 days and will continually refresh every 4 hours.

Each retrieved job will display the job's title, the company's name, the date posted, as well as a short description of the job scope.

Future developments: As this project evolves, we expect to implement a feature where new job postings will be highlighted and emailed to the user.
